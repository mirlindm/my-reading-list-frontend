This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This repository is the front-end to the small back-end application that can be found and accessed here: https://github.com/mirlindm/my-reading-list-backend

I have developed this project in order to learn and make the first project of mine using GraphQL. This is a simple application that lists some books and allows users to add new books to the database. It makes use of MongoDB and Mongoose as per the database, and it is a Node.js/Express application that is build in alignment with GraphQL query language. 
This repo carries the front-end code, which is done using React, HTML and styled with CSS.

You can clone the repo, and run the following commands:
1) npm install
2) npm start

Navigate to the browser: http://localhost:3000/

Note: Make sure to have previously run the back-end application: https://github.com/mirlindm/my-reading-list-backend

You can add new books, fetch a particular book by its id from the list and see the details of that book, such as the name, genre, author and a list of all the books that the author of that book has written, all because GraphQL is AWESOME!
